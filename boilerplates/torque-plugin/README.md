# <torque_plugin_name>

##Â GET STARTED

1.  Copy entire torque-plugin directory into plugins.

    - Include package.json, webpack.config.js, and other config files
    - Exclude node_modules if for some reason it exists

2.  Find and replace the following in the entire directory:

    1.  <torque_plugin_class_name> (eg Torque_Floor_Plans) **Note: aim to always prefix with Torque**
    2.  <torque_plugin_name> (eg Torque Floor Plans)
    3.  <torque_plugin_slug> (eg torque-floor-plans)
    4.  <torque_plugin_namespace> (eg floor-plans/v1/)
    5.  <torque_plugin_shortcode> (eg torque_floor_plan)

3.  Rename directory: torque-plugin => <torque_plugin_slug>

4.  Rename all files in this directory: {torque-plugin}-etc-class.php => {<torque_plugin_slug>}-etc-class.php

5.  Add '<torque_plugin_name>' to cli/lib/workspaces.sh

6.  Open new terminal, and in **project** root, run:

    ```sh
    $ yarn
    ```

    to install/link dependencies.

7.  In **project** root, run:

    ```sh
    $ yarn start <torque_plugin_slug>
    ```

    to compile files to wp-content and start webpack

8.  Delete the README up to here and fill in the rest.
