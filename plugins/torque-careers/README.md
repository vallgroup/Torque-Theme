# Torque Careers

Registers two CPTs:

1.  Careers - a public CPT allowing the user to post job openings, and allowing the theme to display them in a loop.
2.  Job Applicatons - a private CPT for storing submitted job applications in the db. This comes with a class exposing an interface for saving and finding the job applications in the db.
